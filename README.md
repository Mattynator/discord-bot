# Mattynator Discord Bot
We created a Discord bot using Discord.js so you can see how to start and make your own. 
Check the index.js file for the code.

The bot is currently not active and we do not have any official bot that you can invite to your server. You can however take the source code, make any adjustments if you want and host it to use on your server.
